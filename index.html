<h2>Cheetahs</h2>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheetah"><img src="cheetah.png" width=375 height=250/></a>
<p>For more information on Cheetahs , please click on the above image.</p>
<p>Although now found in Africa, the cheetah is believed to have originated in the Americas.</p>
<p>The cheetah is the world’s fastest land animal. They can run as fast as a car on the interstate—up to 70 mph.</p>
<p>Those black tear lines on either side of a cheetah’s nose function like a football player’s black face paint, keeping the sun out of the big cat’s eyes while they hunt.</p>
<p>A cheetah’s claws don’t retract when they run. Instead, they act like cleats to help the cheetah reach its top speeds.</p>
